            <p>The avant-garde art movement began in the mid 19th century, but 
                it didn't reach the fashion world until the early 1900s. For
                many decades avant-garde fashion was not heavily explored, but 
                that changed in the last quarter of the 20th century. Designers 
                like, Vivienne Westwood, Yohji Yamamoto, Rick Owens, and many others,
                started a new revolution in the fashion world. This artistic
                movement was and still is, focused on pushing the boundaries of
                what fashion can be. This style is known for its hyper-creative 
                and seemingly bizarre designs. Avant-garde fashion isn't focused 
                on creating or following trends, but rather its in a whole world 
                of its own.

            <p class="class1">Designer, Rick Owens, launched his brand in 1994, 
                operating out of a store on Hollywood Boulevard, in Los Angeles.
                It didn't take long for the brand to gain popularity in the fashion 
                community, but for years Rick Owens wasn't able to breakthrough this niche 
                subculture and into the mainstream clothing world. That has all 
                changed in the past decade, and especially in the past few years. 
                The rap community has played a big role in the brands new found fame,
                thanks to many famous rap artists wearing and promoting the brand in their
                music. Rick Owen's clothing is known for its dark monochromatic pieces, 
                excessive layering, and unique silhouettes. Rick Owens is heavily influenced
                by the Gothic aesthetic, and has even been referred to as the lord of 
                darkness for his designs.
