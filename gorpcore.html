            <p>The term "Gorpcore" has only been around for a couple of years, 
                but the history of this style stretches back to the start of 
                clothing itself. Clothes were first created to help us withstand
                the elements, and that is the essence of Gorpcore, fashion that 
                has utility. The Gorpcore style as we know it today, comes from 
                clothing made for outdoor activities like, camping, hiking, rock 
                climbing, etc. For many years this style was not seen as
                fashionable, but over time the fashion community realized the 
                artistic potential these clothes could have. As a result, Gorpcore 
                has become one of the fastest growing subcultures in fashion.

            <p class="class1">Dave Lane created Arc'teryx, originally called
                "Rock Solid", in 1989. He started the brand in Vancouver, British
                Columbia, and was heavily influenced by the city's outdoorsy culture.
                For the first couple of years, the company primarily focused on making 
                climbing equipment, but in 1996 they released their first line of
                outdoor apparel. Arc'teryx became a popular brand in the outdoorsy community,
                thanks to their high quality products, but they didn't have much notoriety 
                in the fashion world. That completely changed in the late 2010 s when the 
                Gorpcore movement started to take off, and Arc'teryx quickly became one of
                the biggest names in Gorpcore fashion.
