            <p>Ever since clothing could be viewed as a status symbol, luxury 
                fashion has been around. Luxury fashion as we know it today first 
                gained popularity in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Fashion 
                houses like Hermes, Louis Vuitton, and Burberry ushered in a new 
                era of high end clothing. This style is categorized by a high level 
                of price, quality, and exclusivity. Brand identity is also a huge part
                of luxury fashion, these brands sell more than just clothing, they sell
                a lifestyle.

            <p class="class1">Founded in 1913, in Milan, Italy, by Mario Prada. Originally
                started as a leather goods shop, the brand has grown to become one of the
                most iconic high fashion companies in the world. They specialized in 
                accessorie  for a number of years but then later expanded into producing
                all types of clothing. Simple but sleek designs have become Prada's signature
                look. What sets Prada apart from many other luxury brands is their subtlety, 
                while brands like Gucci and Louis Vuitton slap their logo all over their 
                clothes, Prada focuses on marketing a sense of quiet elegance.
